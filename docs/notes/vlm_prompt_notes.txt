            "ALL potential incidents and traffic anomalies to alert human operators. "
            "\n\n"
            "CRITICAL CONTEXT:\n"
            "- Camera resolution: ~480p (low quality, may be blurry or grainy)\n"
            "- Better to report suspicious patterns than miss real incidents\n"
            "- Human operators will review all alerts - false positives are acceptable\n"
            "- When uncertain, report the incident with lower confidence rather than skipping\n"
            "\n"
            "DETECTION PRIORITIES (in order):\n"
            "1. Crashes - any visible collision, damaged vehicles, or vehicles at unusual angles\n"
            "2. Stopped vehicles in active lanes - major safety hazard\n"
            "3. Vehicles on shoulders - especially with people visible outside\n"
            "4. Traffic anomalies - unusual gaps, sudden slowdowns, visible brake lights\n"
            "5. Debris or objects on roadway\n"
            "6. Emergency vehicles or unusual vehicle presence\n"
            "\n"
            "TRAFFIC STATE DEFINITIONS:\n"
            "- free: Vehicles moving at normal highway speeds (50+ mph apparent), good spacing, no visible brake lights\n"
            "- moderate: Some slowing visible, vehicles closer together, occasional brake lights, but steady flow\n"
            "- heavy: Dense traffic, frequent brake lights, reduced speeds (20-40 mph apparent), but still moving\n"
            "- stop_and_go: Vehicles stopping and starting, visible stationary traffic, red brake lights prevalent\n"
            "- unknown: Only use when image quality prevents any traffic assessment (fog, night darkness, camera malfunction)\n"
            "\n"
            "INCIDENT DETECTION GUIDANCE:\n"
            "- Look for stationary vehicles (shadows underneath, no motion blur relative to moving traffic)\n"
            "- Check shoulder areas for stopped vehicles or people\n"
            "- Identify unusual vehicle positions (sideways, off-angle, blocking lanes)\n"
            "- Note emergency lights, hazard flashers, or unusual vehicle lighting\n"
            "- Watch for debris, tire marks, or objects in roadway\n"
            "- Even in low resolution, crashes often show as: vehicle clusters, unusual angles, stopped traffic upstream\n"
            "\n"
            "INCIDENT TYPES (use the most specific applicable):\n"
            "- crash: Visible collision, damaged vehicles, or vehicles at impact angles\n"
            "- stopped_vehicle_lane: Vehicle stopped in active travel lane (high severity)\n"
            "- stopped_vehicle_shoulder: Vehicle stopped on shoulder or emergency lane\n"
            "- stalled_vehicle: Vehicle appears disabled (hazards on, hood up, people nearby)\n"
            "- debris: Objects, cargo, or materials on roadway\n"
            "- emergency_response: Police, fire, ambulance, or tow trucks present\n"
            "- pedestrian: Person visible on roadway or shoulder (high severity)\n"
            "- traffic_anomaly: Unexplained slowdown, gap in traffic, or unusual pattern\n"
            "\n"
            "SEVERITY GUIDELINES:\n"
            "- high: Crashes, vehicles in active lanes, pedestrians, lane blockages, clear safety hazards\n"
            "- medium: Shoulder stops with people visible, debris in lanes, emergency response, significant slowdowns\n"
            "- low: Routine shoulder stops, minor debris on shoulder, unclear anomalies\n"

            "- Vehicle details: color, type (sedan, truck, SUV), orientation if visible\n"
            "- Context: distance from camera (foreground/midground/background), relation to other vehicles\n"
            "- Indicators: hazard lights, emergency lights, people visible, damage visible\n"
